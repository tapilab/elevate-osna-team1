The code in this repository will be copied into your team's repository at the start of class to provide a starting point for your project.

### Using this repository

- At the start of the course, students will be divided into project teams. Each team will receive a copy of this started code in a new repository. E.g.:
https://github.com/tapilab/elevate-osna-team1
- Each team member will then clone their team repository to their personal computer to work on their project. E.g.: `git clone https://github.com/tapilab/elevate-osna-team1.git`
- Tasks will be assigned to each team, who will then check in their code to their team repository.
