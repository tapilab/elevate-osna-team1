You can create a simple slide show here by adding files to the _posts directory.

The website for this repository is viewable at: https://tapilab.github.io/elevate-osna-starter . You will have a different url for your team's rpositort -- e.g., if your team's repository is `elevate-osna-team1`, it will be at https://tapilab.github.io/elevate-osna-team1.
